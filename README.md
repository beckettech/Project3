Team Name	
Algorithmic Alligatorshh
Team Members
Beckett Hoefling, Ryan Morse, David Vizzi
Project Title
Lions and Tigers and Bears, Oh My!
Problem: What problem are we trying to solve? 
How many of a given type of animal are needed to overthrow a given city?
Given a list of animals, what is the largest city they could overthrow?
Motivation: Why is this a problem? 
We think this is would be an entertaining application for people to use. We also think this is a fairly creative idea for this project.
Features: When do we know that we have solved the problem? 
Provides user with an accurate estimation of the amount of animals that could overtake the given city of humans based on demographics such as average weight and population.
User is able to input a city or a list of animals depending on the option they select and will be given the desired result.
Data: link to public data set 
Link to data
Tools: Programming languages or any tools/frameworks we will be using	
C++
Visuals: Wireframes/Sketches of the interface or the menu driven program 
Command line menu
Visualization: blue text is what is actually being output to the console
Welcome to <insert name of project here>!
Please indicate which process you would like to run:
(1) Enter the name of any city in the world and select a type of animal from the given list and we will tell you the number of that animal needed to overthrow that city based on population.
(2) Enter the type(s) of animal(s) paired with the number of said animal(s) and we will tell you the largest city that could be overthrown with that list of animals.
Would you like a map or bst implementation?
User enters map for map or bst for bst
If Option 1 is selected:
Please enter the name of the world city:
User enters the name of the city
<nameOfCity> would be overthrown by <numOfAnimal> <nameOfAnimal>.
If Option 2 is selected:
Please select the animal(s) from the list provided along with the number of each animal
<list of animals and amounts input by user> would be able to overthrow <nameOfCity>.
Strategy: Preliminary Data Structures we may want to implement 
Binary Search Tree
Sorted in alphabetical order
A at the top of the tree
Map
Key: name of city
Values: country, population
Distribution of Responsibility and Roles: Who is responsible for what?  
Map implementation
David
BST implementation
